# ETH-USD-price-feed-using-chainlink-oracle

Chainlink Price Feeds are the quickest way to connect smart contracts to the real-world market prices of assets. 
The latest price of Ethereum (ETH) inside smart contracts is fetched using the ETH/USD Price Feed on the Kovan testnet.
To consume price data, your smart contract should reference AggregatorV3Interface, which defines the external functions implemented by Price Feeds.
